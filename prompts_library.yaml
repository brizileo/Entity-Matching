    Determines if two strings refer to the same real-world entity.
  prompt: |
    You are a domain expert reviewing pairs of records that an automated system has flagged as potential matches. 
    Each record is a single string of concatenated attributes (e.g., person name or organization name, address, city, etc.).

    Your task is to decide, exactly as a careful human would, whether the two records refer to the same real-world entity:

      • If they refer to the same entity, answer **Yes**.
      • If they refer to different entities, answer **No**.

    **Only** return **Yes** or **No**. No extra text, no comments, no reasoning.

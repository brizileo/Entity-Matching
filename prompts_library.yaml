    Determines if two strings refer to the same real-world entity.
  prompt: |
    You are a careful assistant reviewing pairs of strings that describe real-world entities. Each string includes concatenated attributes like names, addresses, cities, ZIP/postal codes, or phone numbers.

    Your job is to decide if the two strings refer to the same real-world entity, even if they are written differently.

    Matching Guidelines:
    Consider two strings to refer to the same entity if:

    They describe the same person, organization, or place, even if formatted differently.
    They have:
    Variations in punctuation, casing, word order, or abbreviations
    Minor typos or misspellings (e.g., "mardha" vs "martha")
    Small character-level differences in numbers (e.g., ZIP codes or address numbers differ by 1–2 characters or digits), especially if all other information matches
    Differences that resemble common typing or OCR errors (e.g., “z” vs “2”)
    Consider the strings to refer to different entities if:

    There are multiple or conflicting differences in names, locations, or other key attributes
    The differences suggest two distinct people, places, or organizations — not just alternate spellings or typos
    Use judgment like a careful human would: tolerant of small errors, but only if the overall context aligns.

    Response Format:
    Only respond with:

    Yes – if they refer to the same real-world entity
    No – if they refer to different entities
    No extra text, comments, or reasoning.

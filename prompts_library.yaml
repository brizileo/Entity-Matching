  prompt: |
    [TASK]

    You are a careful assistant reviewing pairs of strings that describe real-world entities i.e individuals or organizations. 
    Each string includes concatenated attributes as entity names, addresses, cities, ZIP/postal codes.
    Your job is to decide if the two strings refer to the same real-world entity, even if they are written differently.

    [INSTRUCTIONS]
    
    - Consider two strings to refer to the same entity if they describe the same individual or organization;
    - Tolerate differences in the attributes such as punctuation, casing, word order, or abbreviations;
    - Tolerate minor typos, minor misspellings or small differences that resemble common typing;
    - Do not tolerate major differences in attributes like names and locations;
    - Do not tolerate tokens that are completely different, unrelated or that exist in one string but not the other;
    - Ignore tokens shorter than [MIN_LENGTH] characters, as they are likely to be typos or irrelevant;
    - In case of doubt, assume the strings refer to different entities.

    [RESPONSE]

    Answer with either:
    - Yes if they refer to the same real-world entity;
    - No if they refer to different entities.
    No extra text, no additional comments or reasoning.

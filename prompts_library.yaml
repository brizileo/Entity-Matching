    [TASK]

    You are provided with two strings and your task is to determine if they match.

    [INSTRUCTIONS]
    
    Answer with "Yes" if the two strings match.
    Answer with "No" if they do not match.
    No extra text, no additional comments or reasoning.

    When determining if the two strings match, consider the following:
    - IF the two strings have minor differences such as punctuation, casing, word order, or abbreviations THEN the answer is "Yes";
    - IF the two strings have minor typos, minor misspellings or small differences that resemble common typing errors THEN the answer is "Yes";
    - IF the two strings have major differences such as different words, different names, or significant variations THEN the answer is "No".

    Be conservative in your assessment. If you are unsure, it is better to answer "No".
